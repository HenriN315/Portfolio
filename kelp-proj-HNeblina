# Final Project Part 1
## Intro and Outline
At first, I wanted to tell a story about the importance of predators in ecosystems and how they intersect with human life. I was going to pick a few predators--some more well known (grey wolves, otters) than others (martens, sunflower sea stars, wolverines)--and document how changes in their population and distribution change the ecosystem and landscape.

However, I quickly learned that it isn't easy to come by detailed geographic data about species people don't care about. So instead, I will be focusing on an environment that is comparatively well-studied: kelp forests off the coast of California. 

I am interested in showing the overall health of kelp forests over time. I want to do so by proxy, highlighting the health of two keystone predators, sea otters and sunflower sea stars, and how they interrelate with kelp forest abundance overall.
