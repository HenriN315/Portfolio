# Final Project Part 2: Storyboards & Wireframes
## Storyboarding

Part 1
Talk about how important kelp forests are
* Harbor lots of biodiversity
    + Provides buffer for coastal areas from extreme weather
    + Kelp industry booming, kelp products growing more prominent
    + Is home to protected animal species

Part 2
Introducing Predators
+ Otters are a keystone species of kelp forests in California
    + They eat urchins
    + They help prevent urchins from over grazing on kelp forests
    + They are also cute! 
    + Otters bring much tourism
* Sunflower Sea Star
    + Also a keystone predator in kelp forest ecosystems
    + Are the top predator of purple sea urchin
    + Abundant up until the mid 2000s.

Part 3
Predator populations
+ Otters used to number in the hundreds of thousands, but since the fur trade entered full swing, their numbers were reduced thousands-fold down to only some hundred individuals!
+ However, since the mid 1960s, otter populations have resurged and are now around 2,000
+ Conservation success?
+ Sunflower sea stars have never had trouble with abundance—until 2013.
+ Around 2013, sea star wasting disease pandemic began that reduced the sunflower sea star population—decrease of 90%

Part 4
What does this mean for kelp?
+ Since kelp rely on predators to eat urchins to prevent over grazing, the low numbers of sea otters and sunflower sea stars have greatly decreased coverage
+ In their place are urchin barrens—bare rock where sea urchins litter the sea floor.

Part 5
Call to action
+ Donate to organizations funding research on sea star wasting disease, kelp ecosystems, and sea otter management practices.
