# Final Project Part 2: Storyboards & Wireframes
## Storyboarding

Below is my storyboard for the project. However, all vizualizations are currently held [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/070951e8-c3d6-49d9-8166-4a097fa5b8f1/index.html) for now.
Part 1
Talk about how important kelp forests are
* Harbor lots of biodiversity
    + Provides buffer for coastal areas from extreme weather
    + Kelp industry booming, kelp products growing more prominent
    + Is home to protected animal species

Part 2
Introducing Predators
+ Otters are a keystone species of kelp forests in California
    + They eat urchins
    + They help prevent urchins from over grazing on kelp forests
    + They are also cute! 
    + Otters bring much tourism
* Sunflower Sea Star
    + Also a keystone predator in kelp forest ecosystems
    + Are the top predator of purple sea urchin
    + Abundant up until the mid 2000s.

Part 3
Predator populations
+ Otters used to number in the hundreds of thousands, but since the fur trade entered full swing, their numbers were reduced thousands-fold down to only some hundred individuals!
+ However, since the mid 1960s, otter populations have resurged and are now around 2,000
+ Conservation success?
+ Sunflower sea stars have never had trouble with abundance—until 2013.
+ Around 2013, sea star wasting disease pandemic began that reduced the sunflower sea star population—decrease of 90%

Part 4
What does this mean for kelp?
+ Since kelp rely on predators to eat urchins to prevent over grazing, the low numbers of sea otters and sunflower sea stars have greatly decreased coverage
+ In their place are urchin barrens—bare rock where sea urchins litter the sea floor.

Part 5
Call to action
+ Donate to organizations funding research on sea star wasting disease, kelp ecosystems, and sea otter management practices.


### On missing data visualization drafts
I have no current visualizations for kelp disappearance. However, I have properly processed and sorted approximately 83 million data entries over 40 years on kelp biomass. Because of the extremely large data files, using these entries has proven time-consuming (7 hours for basic sorting). But, now that all the data are sorted, there I will be able to show the disappearance of kelp forests since the beginning of the sea star wasting disease endemic.

## User Interviews
Below are a list of questions asked to all interviewees and their responses, as well as a description of the interviewees.

Interviewee 1: Classmate, masters of public policy student, early 20s
Interviewee 2: Kinesiology student, bachelors degree, early 20s
Interviewee 3: PhD candidate in US history, mid 50s

Questions

What do you think of the tone so far?
1. Persuasive, but a bit passive. Call to action is nice, and the story leads in a clear direction.
2. Tone is good. Very consistent. Does not feel sanitized or clinical. Still feels scientific and serious, but like you are communicating to non-experts.
3. Overall good, but there are some things (in the shorthand version) that need editing. Emphasize the importance of things more--"more important than what?"

Who do you think is the target audience?
1. Audience seems like the general public. Environmentally focused indivisuals, but still general public. Otter lovers.
2. Non-experts who are concerned about the environment, especially marine life. People in the pacific coast.
3. Young people, educators, general public. Anybody who has interest in marine ecology or the environment. Language is approachable and inviting.

Changes to Data Visualizations?
1. Get red of redundant/irrelevant info in your maps. I want to be able to zoom in. Needs a legend. Would be nice to be able to zoom in.
