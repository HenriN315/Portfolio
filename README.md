# Portfolio
A collection of projects I've worked on that demonstrate my skills and growth.

## About Me
Hello! My name is Henri, and I am passionate about the environment. I hope to use environmental policy as a route to changing the way we interact with natural systems, fight climate change, and contribute to a truly sustainable world.

Born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, I made a big move to study physics at the University of Kentucky before changing my major to public policy. I learned so much at the Martin School of Public Policy at UKY, and I look forward to continue growing as I complete my masters of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.

I love to train Muay Thai ü•ä, lift weights üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, play jazz üé∫ (though I am very, very rusty at the moment), and host dinner parties for my friends and family üç∏ ... Now I just need to find a way to do all of these things with only 24 hours in the day.

## What I Hope to Learn
I want bolster my ability to communicate about large, complex problems in ways that are approachable and practical. I am interested in using complex adaptive systems as a link between the ecological and the societal, and being able to create powerful messages with data visualization will be immensely helpful in achieving my goals.
